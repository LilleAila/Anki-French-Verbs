# French verbs anki deck generator

To generate the decks, run `python3 main.py`. To change the input verbs, change `regelrett.txt` for regular verbs and `uregelrett.csv` for irregular verbs. To make this work for english, just change the language of the translations in the input files that start with `Ã¥`.
